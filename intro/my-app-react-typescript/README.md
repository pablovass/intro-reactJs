### **Project Structure Overview**

1. **Main Configuration Files:**
   - **`eslint.config.mjs`**: Configuration file for ESLint, used to enforce consistent code style and detect potential issues in the code.
   - **`next-env.d.ts`**: Automatically generated by Next.js to enable TypeScript support.
   - **`package.json`**: Defines the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
   - **`postcss.config.js` / postcss.config.mjs**: Configuration for PostCSS, used alongside Tailwind CSS for processing styles.
   - **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration file, where you define the paths to your files and customize the theme.
   - **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file, specifying compiler options and rules.

2. **pages Directory:**
   - **`_app.tsx`**: Customizes the root component of the application. Typically used to import global styles and manage global state.
   - **`_document.tsx`**: Customizes the base HTML document. Useful for modifying `<html>` and `<body>` tags or adding external scripts.
   - **`index.tsx`**: The main entry point for the homepage. This is where the primary UI for the homepage is defined.

3. **public Directory:**
   - Contains static assets like images and icons:
     - **`favicon.ico`**: The favicon for the application.
     - **`file.svg`, `globe.svg`, `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `window.svg`**: SVG files likely used in the UI or as examples.

4. **styles Directory:**
   - **`globals.css`**: Global CSS file where Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) are imported.

5. **`README.md`:**
   - Provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the development server, and links to resources for learning more about Next.js. It also includes deployment instructions for Vercel.

### **Project Objective**
The project appears to be academic, designed to help you learn and practice the following technologies:
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building modern web applications with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly designing responsive and modern interfaces.

The focus is on understanding how to set up and work with these tools in a modern development environment.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
